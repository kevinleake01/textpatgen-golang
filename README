The Text Pattern Generator, also known as Textpatgen is a very useful utility
that generates a text file containing data, designed for users to practice
their editing skills using any text editor or word processor. Also using a
word processor such as Libreoffice, you can also test out various fonts, sizes
and colours using the generated text from Textpatgen.

Textpatgen-Golang has been re-written in the Go Programming Language, which has
been known to many people as the most advanced computer programming language in
the 21st Century. If you want to know more about the Go Programming Language,
also known as Golang, see:
