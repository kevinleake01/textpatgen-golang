Textpatgen-Golang
=================
This is the Go Language version of the Text Pattern Generator. For the original<br>
edition written in C, C++, and some D, see http://github.com/kevinleake01/textpatgen.<br>
<br>
The Text Pattern Generator, also known as Textpatgen is a very useful utility<br>
that generates a text file containing data, designed for users to practice<br>
their editing skills using any text editor or word processor. Also using a<br>
word processor such as Libreoffice, you can also test out various fonts, sizes<br>
and colours using the generated text from Textpatgen.<br>

Textpatgen-Golang has been re-written in the Go Programming Language, which has<br>
been known to many people as the most advanced computer programming language in<br>
the 21st Century. If you want to know more about the Go Programming Language,<br>
also known as Golang, see  http://www.golang.org/<br>
