This README is for setting up the Go Programming Language for Textpatgen-Golang.

For those using Linux, there is a script named "setup-golang-linux.sh", and
this will download various documents, tutorials and instructions about
the Go Programming Language, plus how to set up using GCCGO and LLVM/LLGO.

Please note that it will require Subversion (SVN), Mercurial (Hg), and Git
to be installed on your computer.
